What does it look like?\nA girl chooses a dress in an online store. She will need to download her physical data (height, weight, hips, etc.) and a photo that will be received via the web camera of the phone, tablet, laptop on the Afeli platform. We create a virtual copy (avatar), whereby you can use the virtual dressing room in any store in any place in the world.\nThe customer fits on different dresses and sees how they fit and go with exactly at her figure. At any time, you can connect the function of communicating with a live seller, who will consult on the texture, help you to make a choice, etc.\nBut this is only the beginning! In real time, the customer knocks on her friends in our social network and asks for help with choosing a dress. The friends perfectly imagine how their friend looks like in the real life. And due to the 3D copy, they can immediately express their opinion on how this dress will actually fit on the customer.\nAt the same time, the girl (woman) can be sure that this thing fits her in size. The risk of return of the chosen and delivered goods is reduced to a minimum. \nIn addition, it increases the probability of complex purchases of goods. Buying sets of clothes will be a significant advantage of using our marketplace by our customers.\nAll the same applies to millions of other goods, services and entertainment:\n-- Booking a room in a particular hotel. We no longer need to trust the hotelier\'s pictures. We can personally see how the room looks in the real life, walk on it, look into the bathroom and go out on the balcony.\n-- We can also play in a real casino, rather than a virtual one, talk to the dealer and even leave him some tips from the win.\n-- We can independently create any design in our apartment. Then you can immediately place an order for the selected furniture, wallpaper, ceramic tiles, etc. on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

After all, they are in any case successful and sell products online and offline. \nIn fact, this is a superficial view of the issue. With the Internet emergence, almost any business became low-margin. And its owners are trying their best to stand out and take their place in the sun. \nThis is especially true for young, only emerging brands. The latter receive a unique opportunity without a huge budget for advertising and marketing to reach their customers. \nDemonstration of new collections using 3D-avatars sharply highlights such sellers against the background of more conservative competitors.\nBusiness additionally saves huge amounts on the costs associated with the return of goods that do not fit for a particular reason.\nThe subsequent sales to the same customer are facilitated. Today, we receive SMS messages about the new collection arrival in the store. And tomorrow the seller of the Afeli platform will drop the link, by clicking on which the client will immediately see how she looks in the new dress, which has just arrived at the store.\n\n\n5. Difference from competitors\n\nThere are several start-ups in the world, for example, Dressformer.com with the work principles similar to the Afeli project. The main and, in fact, the only source of earnings is   renting the own plug-in with the fitting room functions. The plug-in is mounted in the online store, giving the opportunity to demonstrate the goods on the dummy.\nThe lack of such projects lies in engines based on Flash technology, thus the 3D model adaptation to the project environment causes many mistakes. At the same time, the stores do not have enough to buy this plug-in, but they need to create a whole department for modeling their own products in 3D format.\n Afeli has its own 3D-modeling department, which uses the platform\'s capabilities for the needs of any online store. The latter is enough to embed its web-site code into the plug-in with the 3D Flash-player and place a button \"Try on\" on its goods. The consumer follows the link of the Afeli platform, where he/she can feel all the advantages of a virtual fitting room of any store, entity, entertainment facility.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n6. Afeli description\n 6.1 3D-platform\nThe cornerstone of the Afeli platform is its own innovative 3D platform. The users create their own virtual 3D avatars, as well as the avatars of their home, car and even their favorite cat.\nThe manufacturers, sellers, providers of entertainment content and services create personal 3D-galleries. This creates convenience for users of online stores, which want not only to see the picture of the goods, but to view them in the smallest detail. For example, open all the cabinet doors, consider its functionality from the inside, or see how the fabric sparkles on the chair upholstery when changing the view angle.\n The Afeli platform is based on Unity 3D engine. This makes it unique for adaptation to all the latest goods and computer technologies. The Afeli project is one of the first web-sites adapted for viewing in the virtual reality helmet Oculus Rift + 3D-glasses. The Unity engine allows you receiving the application form downloaded to mobile devices and tablets, having a browser version, and being a full-fledged application downloaded to the users\' personal computers. The Unity license format allows us occupying a new niche that has not been implemented by anyone yet,  being an online store downloaded by the users to Sony PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo gaming devices, etc. \n\n\n\n Main components of the Afeli platform\n\n-- Marketplace\nThe Afeli marketplace opens additional opportunities for the sale of not only clothing, but also the goods of interior design and industrial production. The manufacturers of furniture, accessories, devices can place \"View in 3D\" button on their portals, through which the user will get on the Afeli platform.\n\n-- Social network\nA social network is created from the user accounts like contacts on Facebook social network. However, in addition to photos, Afeli creates 3D-avatars of users, their virtual copies, whereon you can wear different, really existing sets of clothing. The users will be able to exchange messages, post photos of their avatars in other social networks, thereby attracting a new audience to the project. They will be also able to follow the acquisitions of their friends, additionally motivating them and themselves to new purchases.\n\n-- Playground\n The playground is created for maximum customer retention of the platform. Having its own 3D avatar, the user can use it in game projects located on the resource. The given projects can be both of proprietary design and third-party manufacturers. The proprietary projects can be created based on existing network projects in the gaming market. The Afeli platform is based on the game engine, which makes it attractive for most of the game developers. They will complete the list of applications built into Afeli and expand the project functionality by their own\n\n-- Virtual fitting room\nA virtual fitting room gives Afeli the advantage and advantageous difference from other online clothing stores, in which the consumer chooses the goods relying on the photographs, not imagining whether the given thing will fit on him/her or not. When it comes to a set of clothes, which different photos, the selection process, select becomes more difficult, since it is physically impossible to make a complete impression of the image for most people. \n\n-- Internet-entertainment center\n The Afeli project is the next generation online store and the project format allows calling it the Internet-entertainment center. It combines the qualities of an online store, a virtual dressing room, a social network, a platform for computer entertainment, bookings and orders for goods and services. \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.2 Blockchain and database\n\n Afeli is a decentralized platform based on a blockchain technology that connects users, sellers and enterprises directly. This requires working with huge amounts of data coming from all the system participants. \n Afeli uses the Ethereum platform. This blockchain has an excellent reputation and provides all the services necessary for the platform operation. The main problem with integration is the Network capacity, but Ethereum is constantly increasing its capacity and improving its functionality.\nAll the data collected will be stored in its own Data Center. The main requirement (besides the information security) is to organize a repository that allows us repeatedly updating the information in real time and simulate a 3D-image. The Elasticsearch technology will help us to optimize the performance and search function in the stored data array. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Integration with Afeli platform\nThe Afeli platform provides 4 different types of accounts. \n1. Public. \nAnyone who will take the trouble can open the account. The user can create a 3D-avatar with a payment system attached to it (Visa, Mastercard, etc.), with 24/7 feedback and online consultation method. \n2. Corporate. \nIt is provided to the partner corporations with the possibility of 24/7 consultations with the system service administrators. Self-determination of the goods in stock and shipping options, etc. \n3. Moderators.\nTo avoid religion propaganda, pornography distribution, sales of banned substances and drugs, the moderator accounts will be created on the Afeli platform. Their task   is to monitor both public and corporate accounts. \n4. The developers and system administrators account in order they could correct bugs and make other changes to the platform, if necessary.\n\n Platform wallet\n Each user has its own wallet in the Afeli network. It is provided an appropriate security level. The settlement can be made both in fiat money and in the crypto currency through it. The conversion can be made in both directions inside the wallet.\n The exchange fee is 0. That is, there is a fixed exchange rate for each moment when it is possible to convert fiat money into crypto currency and vice versa.\n'),('AfghanCrisis','AfghanCrisis',3,'en','','Monitoring developments in the Afghan war.

Whether they are far too long, too loud and obnoxious, they advertise an entirely different movie than what made it to theaters, or they give away the entire plot of the movie, this is our community to roast the terrible decisions made by Hollywood trailer editors!\n\nRules:\n\nI. Only video links allowed! NSFW is okay if flaired. \n\nII. Video links must be movie trailers or at least relevant!\n\nIII. If relevant, please include the title of the movie in your submission in the following format: \"Name of Movie\" (Year of Release). Again, this is not necessarily required but should be included if possible.\n\nIV. No hate speech of any kind.\n\nV. Any trailers submitted must be bad in themselves OR they may advertise an entirely different movie than what was shown in theaters. \n\nVI. This is not a community for hating on movies or on each other for our taste in movies. I reserve the right to moderate any over-the-top meanie-head behavior.

It aims to retain useful technologies that its sibling Firefox has removed.\nMain features:\n\n\n\n    Full support for JavaScript\'s ECMAscript 6 standard for modern web browsing.\n\n    Support for all NPAPI plugins (Unity, Silverlight, Flash, Java, authentication plugins, etc.).\n\n    Support for XUL/Overlay Mozilla-style extensions.\n\n    Experimental support for WebExtensions (in gecko-target mode). Please note that some Mozilla-specific WebExtension APIs are not yet available.\n\n    Support for ALSA on Linux.\n\n    Support for WebAssembly (WASM).\n\n    Support for advanced Graphite font shaping features.\n\n    Support for modern web cryptography: up to TLS 1.3, modern ciphers, HSTS, etc.\n\nImportant differences with Mozilla Firefox:\n\n\n    Uses Goanna as a layout and rendering engine. Goanna behaves slightly differently than Gecko in certain respects and may result in different display of web pages. e.g.: Goanna renders gradients in a more accurate color space (non-premultiplied).\n\n    Builds on UXP, our XUL platform in development. As such XUL is alive and well in this browser and will not be deprecated.\n\n    Has some long-standing known issues with the Mozilla code-base fixed (e.g. CVE-2009-1232).\n\n    Does not use Rust or the Photon user interface. You can expect a familiar interface as-carried by Firefox between v29 and v56.\n\n    Does not use Electrolysis (e10s, multi-process browsing).\n\n    Does not require walled-garden extension signing.\n\nPale Moon: https://www.palemoon.org\n\nBasilisk: https://www.basilisk-browser.org'),('basisprotocol','basisprotocol',2,'en','','',''),('non-official basis (basecoin) subreddit','Basistoken',2,'en','','Since Basis (Basecoin) apparently hasn\'t created a sub reddit after their rebrand this non-official subreddit hopefully can be a place for clarifying discussions.

How about NOT putting up a fucking pop-up saying \"sssoon\" a day before? How--How about /u/spez not lying to us and saying they\'re not doing an April Fool\'s thing this year? And don\'t pull that \"Well technically it\'s not--\" Fuck you, if they\'re starting it on April Fool\'s day with the pop-up, it IS an April-bloody-Fools Day event.\nOne announcement. That\'s all they needed to do. One. They could\'ve saved us all this bullshit and time-wasting with /r/sneksnek.\nAnd I\'m really not too salty about all of this happening. I\'m kind of salty at the admins for not announcing anything and putting in the \"sssssoon\" way too early. But I\'m also salty at anyone trying to tell me we shouldn\'t have expected the admins to do stuff on Easter when they clearly have access to the site. They added the \"ssssoon\", we had that reply from spez in the group chat (Which could easily have been an official post instead of a side thing less people have access to and which came off as dubious to me), and we had the reply from toasties here.\nPeople are just upset that they had all this build-up and didn\'t deflate people\'s hype until after the fact. Rather than just come out and say \"We have an event tomorrow instead\", they waited until a good while after the fact to say anything. And what they did say is contradictory.\nSpez\'s comment contradicts the pop-up on the Snoo, AND toasties\' comment. Their unclear bullshit is, I\'d hope, unrelated to the actual event but at the same time that just makes me wonder how well thought-out this is. As I\'ve already posted twice: Are we going to find out this was just some dumb social experiment to find out how people react to being given a cryptic clue on the one fucking day a year when people are especially open to cracking codes and shit?\nLike, this event was poorly-planned, no matter how you slice it. As others have said, they had an entire year to do this. And I\'d even be willing to excuse the failure on the actual coding or creation of whatever the event is, if they had communicated with us in a timely manner rather than letting some unofficial person waste everyone\'s time while they (as I just mentioned) continued to contradict each other.\nReally, I just expected better from the people who run such a huge site. Should I not have expected that much? I mean it seems pretty clear-cut to me. If there\'s misinformation out there, should I NOT collaborate with the group I\'m working with to make sure we\'re sending out a clear, consistent message? If something comes up, am I not supposed to let affected people know, particularly when I know confusion could be caused?\nThis seems like high school-level stuff. I\'m not referring to the programming here, I\'m referring to the communication aspect. I apologize for rambling here but this is nonsense I\'ve seen with MULTIPLE communities. I\'ve seen issues of communication with the developers of Team Fortress 2 AND the developer of Hearthstone (Team 5 and by extension Blizzard).\nI don\'t think it\'s entitlement. If it is, I\'m sorry, I don\'t want to come off as some entitled prick who expects to be catered to every minute of the day.

Self serving, independent minded, difficult to train and definitely not your average house pet. Lovingly and only half jokingly nicknamed \"Couch Wolves,\" these dogs\' behavior and taxonomy are holdovers from an earlier age, before industrialization, before pet breeding. All share a primitive temperament and demand more from their humans in exchange for their companionship.','Many breeds fall under the Couch-Wolf designation, though there is no definitive list. In general, when we say couch-wolf, we are referring to several different set of breeds defined both by their genetic phenotype, their history or intended purpose, and their behavior.\n\nThere is something powerful about a couch to a Primitive Dog, more so than with most other dogs. It is something in their nature. Independent-minded dogs base all decisions on self interest, and well, couches are comfy. It\'s a no-brainer. Speaking of self interest, this leads to a second observation. My dog is an expletive.\n\nThe Primitive Dog is a less a breed group and more a category. The necessity for this category is to address certain qualities in these dogs that are commonly ignored or misunderstood. It is the ignorance if these qualities that gets these dog and their owners into trouble.\n\nThe term Primitive Dog is used to group a number of dogs based on specific characteristics. I have included many different dogs from all over the world. Primitive Dogs can be selectively bred to do anything from hunting, to herding, to guarding. What all these breeds have in common is their independent nature, close resemblance to their canine ancestors, and selective breeding that has maintained their behavioral and physiological traits going back thousands of years. Some of the dogs discussed are not ancient breeds, but instead were created in the past 200-500 years specifically to return a dog to its primitive roots.\n\nThis is not to say that dogs who are not purebred, are also not primitive type. Quite the contrary. If a dog has any of the primitive dog traits, then they could be considered primitive type and the information contained on this site still applies. Also feral dogs, island dogs, street dogs, village dogs, and roaming dogs all fit the description and can benefit from the information contained here.\n\n-Molly Sumridge CDBC'),('CougarsnKittens','CougarsnKittens',5051,'en','','Hi, all.

The serious hobbyist usually obtains rolled coins from banks. Coin roll hunters (United States) obtain rolls of cents, nickels, dimes, quarters, half dollars, and sometimes dollars. We open the rolls and search for silver, copper, rarities, high quality coins or coins to complete a collection.\n\nHow Do I Get Coins To Search?\n\nIt is easiest to open a free or cheap bank account. Let the bank know your intentions to order perpetual coin orders, and make sure they are okay with it, or try the next bank. There should never be a fee for coin orders. There are plenty of banks out there if you know where to look and have the means to get there.\n\nWhat Coins Do I Look For?\n\nThat depends... Perhaps CRH is something fun to do with the kids? Are you sorting through pennies for the rare indian heads or wheaties? Are you on a mission for free silver from rolls of half dollars, quarters, dimes, or even nickels? There are also those seeking errors, low mintage, or pieces for collections.\n\nSilver Seekers: U.S. coin denominations of 10 cents or higher can quickly be searched by edge-checking the coin for a white metallic color. This is easy to see with a careful eye, as the edges contrast from the copper edges of post-1964 U.S. coins. U.S. war nickels are 35% silver, and require meticulous searching for years 1943-45.\n\nTips For Starters:\n\nWear Gloves, searching through large amounts of coins can be quite grimy.\n\nUse A Magnifying Glass to better-view details on the coins to verify if there are keepers. Better yet, Use A Digital Microscope!\n\nConsider a hand truck when picking up and dropping off heavy coin batches.\n\nGet a strong bag or wheeled backpack to carry your coins in.\n\nHow Do I Return All These Coins After Searching?\n\nThis is easy if the bank has a free coin counter. Consider a bank (not the same one you order the coins from) that does. While you can return coins to a bank by re-rolling them, it takes time... and coin counting machines with fees can get a big chunk of your cash. Never return coins to the same bank you bought them from; it is bad etiquette.\n\nWhat If My Bank Does Not Have A Coin Counting Machine?\n\nThere are coin wrappers and several coin sorters you can purchase.\n\nMany banks require you to write your account numbers on the coin rolls. Making labels with your account number will streamline re-rolling coin.\n\nWhat To Do With Your Finds:\n\nOrganization is key.

The CrowdPrecision platform lets users build up reputation that helps employers and service providers establish trustworthy cooperation.\n\nCrowdPrecision tackles two of the most significant challenges in current Crowdsourcing applications - quality control of the work submitted and fast and cost-effective payment mechanisms.\n\nDue to the large number and the anonymity of the huge group of Crowdsourcing workers, it is often difficult to identify the skill set of individual workers and to track down workers with deliberately malicious behavior, a factor which often leads to a great waste of time and money by all parties involved (employers, workers and platform providers).\n\nTo address those problems, CrowdPrecision uses Ethereum-based smart contracts between employers and workers. By issuing CrowdPrecision Tokens (CPT), CrowdPrecision provides a complete ledger of a user s Crowdsourcing history   whether as employer or worker   and makes it available across multiple Crowdsourcing platforms. Therefore, it features:\n\n* Transparent and straightforward display of a worker s qualifications and diligence for an easy distinction between high and low quality workers.\n\n* Track record of a worker transferable across multiple Crowdsourcing marketplaces.\n    \n* Facilitated identification of fair employers through their payout profile.\n\n\nWe decided against a solely decentralized platform. Our experiences show that there are always cases that can not be clarified automatically. Therefore, our platform has a group of experts who serve as a point of arbitration and take into account both, the interests of employees and employers in a neutral way.\n\nThe introduction of CPT enables all Crowdsourcing parties to build up a trust-based marketplace system which considerably reduces the overhead of quality control mechanisms and qualification tests. Consequently, the CrowdPrecision marketplace offers higher quality results at lower costs and at a faster pace.\n\nVarious members of CrowdPrecision have worked for established Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Microworkers.com and are experienced in dealing with all aspects of today s Crowdsourcing technology, including efficient workflow design, process and cheat detection, and quality enhancement techniques. With this experience, the team is well aware of Crowdsourcing s customer needs. This is reflected in the CrowdPrecision concept that a certain level of administration is required to guarantee quality of modern Crowdsourcing.\n\n**Our Partner**:\n\nWe have a partnership with [Microworkers.com](https://www.microworkers.com/), it is one of the largest microtasking crowdsourcing platforms, with an international workforce of over one million. It started operations in 2009 and supports various types of tasks, such as consumer surveys, tagging and categorization of content, data extraction and enrichment, and individual self-service.\n\n\nVisit us on **[CrowdPrecision.io](http://crowdprecision.io/)** and join our Initial Token Sale.

They contain a ton of outdated information or simply posts from misinformed users. Ultimately if you have a question that needs a proper answer, ask the subreddit or a moderator. Always consider the source.**\n\n\n**RULES**\n\n1) This is a Harm Reduction Subreddit\n* Please do not encourage any dangerous behavior or insanely ill-advised drug combinations. We are here to help you.\n\n2)Be Civil\n* Do not be overtly antagonistic. Show respect and you will be treated with respect. Mods will issue 1 warning for this and then you will be banned.\n\n3) NO SHITPOSTING\n* This is important here. You can post something you want to share you may find funny, but do not shitpost repeatedly or tell lies. THIS RESULTS IN IMMEDIATE BAN.\n\n4) Legality\n* DXM can only be bought by those 18+. If a mod finds out you are engaging in any kind of illegal behavior they will have to remove your posts. This is in accordance will Reddit rules. Those under 18 may participate and ask questions as a form of harm reduction, but do not make posts about how to buy or steal it.\n\n\n**HARM REDUCTION**\n* [General DXM Harm Reduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/dxm/wiki/index/dxm_safety)\n\n* DXM is a relatively safe drug if used properly. It has been concluded that DXM itself is not neurotoxic. However, DXM bought over the counter comes in the form of a hydrobromide acid salt. This is where the true danger lies. Too many bromide ions can lead to bromide poisoning or metabolic. DXM itself is not inherently neurotoxic but it may become so through these mechanisms if you abuse it heavily. Doing the math, DXM Hbr is 30% by weight and it takes 500mg of bromide to cause bromide poisoning. This means that taking 1666mg of DXM Hbr is well within neurotoxic range. However, taking 1000mg+ is still a safety concern and may cause some damage to the liver or brain. Please exercise caution when using high doses.\n\n* DXM addiction is a real thing that can actually happen. Please follow the \"week per plateau\" rule and practice moderation. Be responsible and accountable.\n\n* Please do not be afraid to ask questions to the subreddit or moderators in regards to safety. Many of us have researched the substance at length and would be happy to help.\n\nBe safe, and have fun!\n\nWritten by: u/DrSigmaFreud'),('#DaarZo','daarzo',4,'en','','',''),('DACs','DACs',2,'en','','DACs - Decentralized Autonomous Corporations\n','DACs\n\n/r/FullAutoCapitalism\n/r/DAO\n/r/GoldAndBlack'),('Extreme Dad Calves','dad_calves',1,'en','','Post your juicy dad calves.

The vapor rises up into colder areas of the atmosphere and once cooled to saturation, a cloud becomes visible.\n\n\n\n> Storms form when heated air rises in an updraft, being less dense than the surrounding air. The air cools as it rises, condensing water vapor and forming cumulus clouds. At some point, condensation high in the cloud (now in the form of water droplets and ice) falls to the ground as rain.\n\n-\n*I am the daughter of Earth and Water,*\n\n\n\n*And the nursling of the Sky;*\n\n\n\n*I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;*\n\n\n\n*I change, but I cannot die.*\n\n~ Percy Shelley, 1813\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n**In a learning mood?

Taking care of ultra-dry skin could be quite a bit tricky, particularly in the event you learn your dry skin sensitive to the typical skincare solutions. One of the easy to pick the ideal weleda purifying lotion to extra dry skin is to understand exactly what works to rejuvenate the pain and inflammation of skin dryness - and what will not. Preferably ones that may help lock on the skin\'s natural moisture; while still pulling moisture out of the air at the exact same time.\n\nDon\'t make the mistake of choosing skincare products simply as they are endorsed or popular by your favorite celebrity; you could well be let down should you so. The simple truth is that most of the popular brands don\'t contain the ideal ingredients; ergo, the do not create the desired results. The garnier gradual tan that is best is the one that contains effective and safe ingredients.\n\nChemicals\n\nMajority of the skincare products outside there are saturated in chemicals which are too harsh for skin; hence, they remove the pure oil and moisture from skin. By so doing they make the skin dry and cause irritation, inflammation and redness; some of the usual compounds found in the skin creams/lotions are parabens, scents, sulfates and alcohols. The best body lotion should contain all natural ingredients that are organic because they have gentle results and are safe for the skin.\n\nMoisturizers These deep penetrating plant oils are demonstrated to attract moisture from the atmosphere and seal it inside the dermis; even better yet they neither obstruct the pores nor have greasy influence on the epidermis.\n\nSkin protections\n\nA top quality dr organic moisturiser should additionally protect the skin against free radicals out of the sun and other environmental pollutants.

Its colorful golden crest feathers give rise to its English and scientific names, and possibly to it being called the \"king of the birds\" in European folklore. Several subspecies are recognized across the very large distribution range that includes much of Eurasia and the islands of Macaronesia. Birds from the north and east of its breeding range migrate to winter further south.\n\n','Yo so u know this great bird the goldcrest,   The goldcrest (Regulus regulus) is a very small passerine bird in the kinglet family. Its colourful golden crest feathers gives rise to its English and scientific names, and possibly to it being called the \"king of the birds\" in European folklore. Several subspecies are recognised across the very large distribution range that includes much of Eurasia and the islands of Macaronesia. Birds from the north and east of its breeding range migrate to winter further south.\n\nThis kinglet has greenish upper-parts, whitish under-parts, and has two white wingbars. It has a plain face contrasting black irises and a bright head crest, orange and yellow in the male and yellow in the female, which is displayed during breeding. It superficially resembles the firecrest, which largely shares its European range, but the latter\'s bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The song is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly higher-pitched than those of its relative. Birds on the Canary Islands are now separated into two subspecies of the goldcrest, but were formerly considered to be a subspecies of the common firecrest or a separate species, Regulus teneriffae.\n\nThe goldcrest breeds in coniferous woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Ten to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second broods are common. This kinglet is constantly on the move as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits. It may be killed by birds of prey or carry parasites, but its large range and population mean that it is not considered to present any significant conservation concerns. The goldcrest is the smallest European bird, 8.5 9.5 cm (3.3 3.7 in) in length,[2] with a 13.5 15.5 cm (5.3 6.1 in) wingspan and a weight of 4.5 7.0 g (0.16 0.25 oz). It is similar in appearance to a warbler, with olive-green upper-parts, buff-white underparts, two white wing bars, and a plain face with conspicuous black irises. The crown of the head has black sides and a narrow black front, and a bright crest, yellow with an orange centre in the male, and entirely yellow in the female;[3][4] the crest is erected in display, making the distinctive orange stripe of the male much more conspicuous.[5] The small, thin bill is black, and the legs are dark flesh-brown. Apart from the crest colour, the sexes are alike, although in fresh plumage, the female may have very slightly paler upper-parts and greyer underparts than the adult male. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but has duller upper-parts and lacks the coloured crown. Although the tail and flight feathers may be retained into the first winter, by then the young birds are almost indistinguishable from adults in the field.[6] The flight is distinctive; it consists of whirring wing-beats with occasional sudden changes of direction. Shorter flights while feeding are a mix of dashing and fluttering with frequent hovering. It moves restlessly among foliage, regularly creeping on branches and up and down trunks.[3]\n\nIdentification\n\nNominate R. r. regulus in Belgium. The goldcrest has a bright crest and a relatively plain face. A little orange is seen at the back of the crest, indicating a male.\nThe goldcrest is usually easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion with the common firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could be more difficult to distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.[6]'),('Daddy\'s little angles ','GoldenGuiets',1,'en','','Edits of guiets and throwers related items ',''),('one true god','goldenmasterrace',3,'en','','one true golden','pictures of golden'),('EAR/ONS/GSK','goldenstatekillergsk',0,'en','','A place for free discussion of the Golden State Killer/ East Area Rapist/ Original Night Stalker case.','Please, no identifying information of private individuals.\n\nNo \"respected posters\", no self promoting blog writers or podcasters, no cold case writers are allowed here.'),('GoldJacketLuke','GoldJacketLuke',2,'en','','A place to discuss topics of GoldJacketLuke videos.

They include ovicides and larvicides used against insect eggs and larvae, respectively. Insecticides are used in agriculture, medicine, industry and by consumers. Insecticides are claimed to be a major factor behind the increase in the 20th-century\'s agricultural productivity. Nearly all insecticides have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems; many are toxic to humans and/or animals; some become concentrated as they spread along the food chain.\n\nInsecticides can be classified into two major groups: systemic insecticides, which have residual or long term activity; and contact insecticides, which have no residual activity.\n\nFurthermore, one can distinguish three types of insecticide. 1. Natural insecticides, such as nicotine, pyrethrum and neem extracts, made by plants as defenses against insects. 2. Inorganic insecticides, which are metals. 3. Organic insecticides, which are organic chemical compounds, mostly working by contact.\n\nThe mode of action describes how the pesticide kills or inactivates a pest. It provides another way of classifying insecticides. Mode of action is important in understanding whether an insecticide will be toxic to unrelated species, such as fish, birds and mammals.\n\nInsecticides may be repellent or non-repellent. Social insects such as ants cannot detect non-repellents and readily crawl through them. As they return to the nest they take insecticide with them and transfer it to their nestmates.

It is natural that those intrigued by that which defies explanation should seek out like minded individuals to exchange theories and posit solutions. On reddit, some subs have even achieved the acclaim of having aided in solving mysteries. One must look no futher than the tale of Jason Callahan to learn more. \n\nThe thing that separates the Key Lime Pie mystery from the rest is that it is a mystery born of the internet itself. I hesitate to describe it here because of the ever-shifting nature of the case- we simply don\'t know much solid information, and what we do know seems to change every time we look deeper. But the foundation of the mystery lies in a string of bizarre posts on forums across the web posting seemingly nonsensical statements about a wide range of things, referencing most commonly a \"Captain Kutchie\" and his \"Key Lime Pie\". The stickied post is the archive of the efforts to quantify the phenomenon so far, as well as some interesting takes. \n\nI founded this subreddit because the sheer amount of information is baffling to any individual. I can\'t do it alone. The only way we can hope to learn more is to search- this is one mystery that we can solve from our keyboards. There exists out there in cyberspace some entity with an unknown motive, and I want to assemble a team to find out what that is and to find out why it acts like it does. If it is a man behind a screen, I want to know his name. And who knows? You might even run into a post without even looking for it. \n\nMy white whale is lime green and it is a Captain all on it\'s own. I hope you will aid me in meeting it.

To get an idea of the psychical traits of a species you can check the wikipedia page on it. To get an idea of when they can be found, the frame of time they grow is given on the page for the species in [Shroomery\'s Psilocybin Mushroom Catalog] (https://www.shroomery.org/12230/Psilocybin-Species) which provides the season where the climate conditions allow them to fruit by stating the months which begin and end of the season they are able to grow.\n\nSo, instead of asking people on the internet if some mushrooms you found happen to be active, you can determine whether or not they are by...\n1. Finding out which species are known to inhabit your general location at the Shroomery catalog of which species\' grow in what areas and compare the characteristics of the species\' listed with the kind it claims you occur in your area. Keep in mind that you will not be able to find a species at a time of year they aren\'t able to grow.\n2. If the kind you have found looks similar enough to a kind that occurs in your area, and you did find it the time of year is when the species you think it is similar enough to justify further inspection, check to see if it bruises blue when handled roughly because very few Psilocybin Mushrooms do not bruise blue reaction and barely non-magical species bruise blue. The blue bruises are due to Psilocin oxidizing when being exposed to the air by damage to the tissue which contains it. \n**(Psilocin is the chemical responsible for the psychoactive effects, and the more familiar compound \"Psilocybin\" converts into Psilocin when consumed. Psilocybin does not bruise blue, the species of mushroom known as \"Liberty Caps\" don\'t bruise blue because it contains no Psilocin, but still is an popular magic species to forage)**\n3.

They are the tools that can transform a face into the most beautiful one. There are various varieties of makeup brushes. As with any other product, there are professional brushes as well as lower quality brands. The price difference is marked, but so is the difference in quality. The lower quality-ones break quickly, and the chances of skin irritation increase many folds. If you want a brush that will last longer and will not have any adverse effect on the sensitive skin, you should use the professional ones. \n\nNormally, professional brushes are made with goat, sable or squirrel hair. There is a wide variety of shape and sizes in case of shimmer highlighter Makeup. Each one is made with specific function in mind. The types include:\n\n1. The most common type of brush that you will see is the foundation brush. They are soft, U-shaped and large. They can easily cover a large area and quickly too. \n\n2. For setting foundation, powder brush is the best. It is also a soft, large brush that sweeps the whole face. The rounded end makes it easier to cover the face, even in the curvy areas.\n\n3. Concealer brush is harder than most other types. It is made of synthetic hair. But the size is smaller and rounded. They are used to apply makeup to any red areas or the face or to any blemish. As the brush is small, it can easily reach even the corner of the nose.\n\n4. One type of brush that comes in with both synthetic and natural hair is the applicator brush. They also come in various sizes! They are mainly used for applying eyeshadow. You should buy both a smaller and a larger applicator brush as the choice of size depends on the type of makeup.\n\n5. To line the eyes or to fill in the eyebrows, you need the angled brush. It is the hardest of all brushes and are made with synthetic hair. The name comes from its angled shape. They are best suited to the areas of the face which are otherwise hard to reach.\n\n6. The one brush that is almost crucial for any brush set is the blending brush. It has natural bristles that can eliminate any hard line. They works in collaboration with the applicator brush but is much softer and rounder.\n\n7. One of the best brushes to work on the cheeks is the blusher brush. As the name suggests, they are best for controlling the amount of colour in the cheeks. They work better than the powder brush and is a fraction smaller in size.\n\n8. No brush set can be completed without lipstick brush. These brushes are made with both natural and synthetic bristles, so it a bit harder. This makes it suitable for using on the mouth. The shape is almost V, so you can use them on the edges and fill them.'),('Makeup Over 50','Makeupneversleeps',2,'en','','What is your world like over 50....',''),('Making History: The Calm & The Storm','MakingHistoryThegame',2,'en','','a subreddit about the game Making History: The Calm & The Storm\nand Making History:the great war',''),('philippines, malate, manila','MalateManila',3,'en','','A subreddit dedicated to my home town of Malate.','It can be either malate related news, articles etc.'),('Male Living Style','malelivingstyle',1,'en','','',''),('Male PeeGoneWild','malepeegonewild',2,'en','','Like PeeGoneWild but for Male Content!',''),('mamdona','mamdona',4,'en','','reserved for mamdona\n\nIs that you?

It\'s a discussion place for all things CLD.\n\nThe core mission of CLD is to become the go-to place for non-cookie-cutter, high-quality personals in the United States. The kind of posts that would have gone on Craigslist in the past. The kind of posts that no longer have an obvious home elsewhere on the web.\n\nCLD aims to recapture what made the Craigslist personals section great and unique: freeform text, spontaneity, anonymity, and critical mass. At the same time, it aims to significantly improve on the Craigslist experience by cutting down on spam and low-quality posts.\n\nCLD is for casual encounters, relationships, platonic connections, and everything in between\n\n\nRules\n\n  Don\'t write crappy posts\n\nCLD is primarily aimed at people who genuinely enjoy connecting with others through writing. Writing actual words. At least a little bit.\n\nSo, what should you write?\n\nWrite something fun.\n\nWrite something unexpected.\n\nWrite something kinky.\n\nWrite something whimsical.\n\nWrite something explicit.\n\nWrite something spontaneous.\n\nWrite something erudite.\n\nWrite something evocative.\n\nWrite something that gives the community a taste of who you are as a unique person (or couple, or group).\n\nThrowaways are encouraged, so don\'t be shy. Tell us what you\'re looking for. What you want. What you need.\n\nTell us where your mind\'s at, right at this moment. Maybe your mind\'s in the clouds. Maybe it\'s in the gutter. Both are welcome.\n\nUnless you write like James Joyce, one-sentence posts are generally not allowed. If you could just as easily be using Tinder, use Tinder.\n\nIf your post is composed entirely of basic stats (age, sex, height, weight, ethnicity, location, etc.)... it will get deleted.\n\nIf your post gives no insight into how you\'re different from a cut-rate spambot... it will get deleted.\n\nIn short, your post should demonstrate that you are a real person with a distinctive voice, personality, or set of desires. (Don\'t worry, you can still post for hookups and be completely filthy. Just be enticing too.)\n\n  Repost at most weekly\n\nDon\'t repost the same thing more than once per week. If you do repost (after at least a week), please delete your older post at the same time.\n\nIt s fine to have multiple different posts up at the same time   just don t overdo it.\n\n  Use keywords and search\n\nLiberal use of keywords (as a poster) and search (as a reader) is highly encouraged.\n\nPlease include whatever location keywords seem relevant:\n\nRegion (SF, North Bay, South Bay, East Bay, Peninsula, Santa Cruz)\n\nCity (Oakland, Menlo Park, San Rafael, etc.)\n\nNeighborhood (Nob Hill, Temescal, etc.)\n\nInclude sex/gender if applicable (m4f, f4m, m4m, mf4mf, etc.)\n\nUse r when sex/gender isn\'t important (r4r, f4r, etc.)\n\nIf you want to indicate trans-ness, please use tm for trans male and tf for trans female (i.e. tm4f = trans male for female)\n\nUse other keywords strategically to help people find your post through search (i.e.  climbing ,  BDSM ,  beekeeping )\n\n  (Mostly) no dick pics\n\nIf you are one male seeking one female (m4f), do not include a dick pic. Dick pics in all other categories (i.e. m4m, mf4mf, etc.) are okay.\n\n  Don\'t be evil\n\nAfter careful review of the elaborately articulated rules of multiple established sub-reddits, complete with multivariate cross-referencing and big data / machine learning analysis, SFCLD has concluded that a useful umbrella rule is: be a nice person. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\n  One strike!\n\nIf you post something that violates the rules (including rule -1-), the offending account will be banned.\n\nYes, this is unusually harsh. However, SFCLD is an experiment to see what kind of community evolves when there is a very strong norm against generic, crappy, spammy posts.\n\nWe want both quantity and quality, but quality wins.\n\nEtiquette\n\nIf you like someone\'s post, send a private message. Don\'t comment \"PMed!\". Please only comment on a post if you\'re saying something more substantial.'),('Massachusetts Votes','massachusettsvotes',1,'en','','This is a 100% nonpartisan voter information subreddit.

The low stakes and ease of use helped millions of people connect over the years   ranging from hookups, to relationships, to friendships, to marriages, to strange, wonderful, uncharacterizable interactions between people whose paths would almost certainly have never intersected in any other way.\n\nWhatever sadness we feel about the immediate loss, and whatever graver concerns about internet freedom, I want to focus on something positive: We now have a chance to make something better.\n\nLet s face it: Craigslist was classic, but it was hopelessly out of date. It periodically made minor inexplicable adjustments to the UI and just as frequently reversed those adjustments. It was completely overrun by spam to the point where it was barely useable. It was awful on mobile. Flagging of bad posts was an inefficient and maddening black box. There was a year or so in which a high percentage of published posts would mysteriously \"ghost\" and never actually become visible at all. Of course, Craigslist was free and not even ad-supported, so all of this was understandable, but still   when a monopoly dies, it s a chance for innovation.\n\n**The goal**\n\nMKECLD aims to rebuild the now defunct Craigslist personals by creating a new community, while also taking the opportunity to make improvements.\n\nThe Craigslist personals section was unique because of four crucial features:\n\n-1- Freeform Text\n\nCraigslist posts were primarily written. Yes, you could add photos, but the core of a post was text. And not just any text, but freeform text. Craigslist didn t tell you what questions to answer or what information to provide about yourself. It let you decide what to say. Because of this, it naturally encouraged all sorts of human connections, including ones that couldn t easily be characterized by labels like friendship or dating or sex. It was a place where you could whisper into the void about whatever you wanted and see who whispered back.\n\n-2- Spontaneity\n\nCraigslist posts weren\'t based on a profile. You didn\'t have to spend hours (if you re an obsessive person, maybe hundreds of hours ) crafting the most perfect profile possible. You weren t trying to create a complete representation of a digitally-scrubbed but still just-about-honest persona (I m looking at you, OkCupid). Your ego wasn t nearly as invested. As a result, people were much more willing to give it a try, to be whimsical, to be kinky, to experiment with new versions and aspects of themselves. To be spontaneous and say what was on their mind at that moment. To feel that they could unabashedly express a *part* of themselves, rather than their whole self.\n\n-3- Anonymity\n\nCraigslist didn\'t require a Google or Facebook account or an invitation. It was (and still is) very easy to sign up. It didn\'t give out your contact information or identity. And you could read and reply to posts without even making an account at all.

People who weren t particularly internet savvy knew about Craigslist. People of all generations knew about Craigslist. People all over the world knew about Craigslist. Even though lots of other options came along that were vastly better in a variety of ways (OkCupid, Tinder, Hinge, Meetup, Nextdoor, FetLife, reddit, etc.), Craigslist was always there in the collective subconscious. It was the baseline; the default; the universal place of last resort to meet someone new.\n\nIt is the goal of this community to create and maintain a space that will offer it\'s users exactly what Craigslist used to offer, and hopefully something that can grow to be even better over time. \n\nThe greatest hurdle is exposure, so please share this sub as much as you can and bear with it as much as possible, as it will be a long time before any significant critical mass is reached. \n\n**MKECLD Rules**\n\nRules of a more comprehensive nature to follow soon.

Instead you will use the Moneda platform and stake the MND tokens you invested (ETH is also a payment option). You will put in MND and make an investment portfolio. Then, once your portfolio goes to the moon (we hope) you will withdraw more MND than you started with! If you unfortunately lose money on your investment, you\'ll take out less MND.\n\n**Machine Learning + Blockchain:** To help you with investing, we will compile a large amount of data with the help of machine learning. This data will be used to help you set up a portfolio, or to \"rate\" your portfolio\'s chance of success! By passing this data on to you, we hope to build a successful ecosystem on the platform!\n\n**Social Investing:** We also promote sharing your portfolio with others on the platform. This lets you see what other people are doing, and lets them see what you are doing. Moneda is centered around building a successful investment platform.\n\n**Security of Your Investment:** How secure are your investments? Well, we back up each coin you\'re investing in by actually buying them! If you invest an amount in Bitcoin on the Moneda platform, our background microservices automatically buys that same amount of the cryptocurrency. By doing this, we make sure we can pay our users out in the occurrence that the coin goes up 1000x.\n\n**Cold Storage of MND:** We store your MND and ETH in secure cold wallets to maintain the security of your investment. Once you decide you want them back, we send them back to you from those cold wallets! Not only does this act as a strong security measure, but us buying the MND you put in and selling the MND you pull out maintains a supply and demand for the token!\n\n*Moneda Social Channels:*\n\n[Website](https://www.getmoneda.io)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/getMoneda)\n\n[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/getMoneda)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/getMoneda)'),('MoneroV','Monero_V',1,'en','','The F(or)ked Version of Monero','What exactly is MoneroV?\n\nMoneroV (XMV) is a private, untraceable, finite and secure cryptobullshit fork of the Monero (XMR) blockchain.

No inappropriate behavior\n- No spam, referrals or advertising\n- Price, trading and market discussion in Daily Discussion only\n- No duplicate threads\n- No low-quality content or questions\n- No misleading titles\n- No using multiple accounts\n- English language only\n\n### Introduction to Pareto Network\n1.  The Pareto Network is the first peer to peer financial content marketplace. It connects providers of financial information in the cryptocurrency space with investors, providing foresight into market inefficiencies and opportunities.\n- Content creators can earn money by sharing financial information that benefits people in the network. When investors compensate content creators, their ranking goes up which gives them faster access to more actionable information in the future.\n- Digital currencies are extremely volatile. The lack of specialized financial information makes it extremely hard for investors to pinpoint the tokens that will outperform the market, especially given that there are more coins being released every day. The Pareto Network aims to bring forward information about market inefficiencies and promote more accurate price discovery. It therefore advances the level of understanding of cryptocurrency investment analysis and steers the markets towards correcting the prices of these assets.\n- The Pareto token, PARETO, is an Ethereum ERC20 compatible token that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Its holders can use it to **pay content creators on the network, and receive specialized information about investment opportunities** before everyone else.\n\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n1.  Most information can be found in the [Pareto Network Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ParetoNetwork/wiki/index) \n- You can follow the steps in [this blog post](https://blog.pareto.network/how-to-access-the-pareto-network-with-a-web3-browser-8c7dfa917c0b) to access the Pareto Network platform.\n- You can store PARETO as you would any other ERC20 token. You can use any ERC20 compliant wallet which you control the private keys for. A few good examples are MyEtherWallet, Parity, Mist, or Metamask.\n\n\n\n### Blog Posts\n\n 1.

See you there!','PeerAtlasICO',2,'en','','The mission of PeerAtlas is to instantly spread the most modern techniques and knowledge in healthcare, free of charge, worldwide. \n','ATLAS: A Digital Token Supporting an Open-Source Medical Encyclopedia\n\nAbstract. Mobile devices and the Internet have changed how caregivers in Western medicine access critical knowledge. Subscription-based online resources now contain the best information for doctors to treat patients. Large publishing houses have monetized this valuable content with paywalls. We propose an open-source online medical encyclopedia with peer-reviewed information available free of charge worldwide. The ATLAS token will be an NEP-5 asset registered on the NEO blockchain used to reward creators of articles and algorithms useful to medical professionals. ATLAS tokens will also be used to redeem continuing medical education (CME) credits awarded to doctors and other professionals. In this manner, PeerAtlas can offer a high-quality medical resource created by paid professionals without selling advertising or limiting access with subscriptions. \n\nATLAS\n \nPeerAtlas will register its digital token, ATLAS, as an NEP-5 asset on the NEO blockchain. Issuing ATLAS enables a business model that seeks to give PeerAtlas the easy availability of a free medical resource and the high quality of a paid project. Whitepaper v0.81 whitepaper.peeratlas.com November 22, 2017 ATLAS will transact in two major pathways that directly benefit the project. Firstly, direct donations of ATLAS will be enabled for verified creators of medical articles and algorithms that the community finds useful. This allows contributing professionals to receive compensation for their time and effort. Secondly, medical professionals using the site will accumulate continuing medical education (CME) credits that will be redeemable through the site in exchange for ATLAS tokens. ATLAS tokens will be minted by the execution of a smart contract on the NEO blockchain. This will create a supply of 100,000,000 NEP-5 tokens. ATLAS tokens cannot be created or destroyed after this genesis event, so total supply is fixed at 100 million. The ATLAS token will be divisible and transferrable to the fourth decimal place (0.0001 ATLAS). Distribution of the 100 million ATLAS will be approximately as follows, subject to minor change: 30% retained by the PeerAtlas foundation, 3% held by PeerAtlas founders, 17% sold to selected pre-ICO buyers, and 50% in the ICO crowdsale. Tokens retained by the PeerAtlas foundation will be issued frozen and then unlocked in stages of 10 million tokens at 3, 36, and 120 months after the ICO. The 3 million tokens retained by the founders will be issued frozen and unlocked after 12 months. The ATLAS token is intentionally made simple for medical professionals that may be new to blockchain technology. \n\n\nRoadMap \n\n* August 2009: PeerAtlas founder Dr. Brad Mattson enters medical school\n* December 2011: Dr. Mattson consults PeerAtlas co-founders Dr. Colin Closser and Dr. Ling Wu with the vision that will later become PeerAtlas, and begins coding the site from scratch\n* May 2013: Dr. Mattson graduates with his M.D. degree from medical school\n* July 2013: Dr. Mattson enters a five-year radiology residency\n\nAtlas ICO\n\n* January 2018: The ATLAS ICO website is launched and token metrics are released.

However a person is still allowed to cut after the 24 hour mark if the next ranker has not yet cut.\n\n* Endgame will consist of 22 Pokemon.  Every ranker will rank the 22 endgame Pokemon separately, then the average of those lists will be the endgame order.\n\n* Every ranker has five Revives.  After a cut, a ranker can use one of their Revives to nullify the cut, putting that Pokemon back in the pool of Pokemon that can be cut.

We need to remove the powerful intermediaries, create new incentive structures, build commonly owned tools to validate all research and build a common Validated Repository of human knowledge.\n\nA combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence provides the technology framework, but as with all research, the scientist herself needs to be in the center. \n\nThat is what we are proposing with Project Aiur, and we hope you will join us.

Thus, when coming from a particular viewpoint we may easily dismiss valid ideas about psychosocial influences on the brain and vice versa. The brain and behavior as it relates to human experience is a topic of extraordinary breadth and our explanatory models are rudimentary. Interactions between these many viewpoints have untapped potential to enrich our understanding of psychiatry and related disciplines. ','Guidelines: \n\n1   Anti- or critical psychiatry viewpoints are welcome here. We are all here to learn about divergent ideas about psychiatry. The greater the difference of perspective the more potential to learn. Encouraging interactions between mainstream views of psychiatry and antipsychiatry is a fundamental goal of this subreddit.  \n\n2   All other viewpoints are also welcome, but since the spirit is understanding, please refrain from personal attacks that defame a poster based on their fundamental orientation. This includes calling psychiatrists \"soul rapists\" and \"torturers\", but also wielding psychiatric and other colloquial language as a weapon (\"psycho\", \"you probably have schizophrenia\", \"crazy\", \"borderline\", etc.) There aren\'t rules about what you can and can\'t say, just a request to not intentionally insult others.\n\n3   Terminology is going to be of central disagreement, but we should try to use words accurately and fairly, understanding that some psychiatric terminology could be viewed as derogatory. However, please try to be tolerant of the language others use, because in order to discuss something you have to name the phenomena. \n\n4   We will avoid banning people from the subreddit at all costs to support maximal dialogue. However, repeated abusive, unproductive or caustic commenting can result in someone being banned regardless of orientation. We do not anticipate that this will be necessary, but reserve the right in rare circumstances.  \n\nI founded this subreddit, after extensive interactions with the antipsychiatry movement on Reddit and Mad In America over the last 6 years. I am a psychiatrist, thus operated as a dissenting voice, but I think that I have benefited immensely from the interactions I\'ve had.  Some of my opinions have changed, others softened, but I think approaching psychiatry from a perspective of trying to understand these viewpoints can be really valuable. I am an optimist by practice and think psychiatry can evolve and I\'m excited about the potential for neuroscience to revolutionize psychiatry. However, I think psychiatry uses incredibly sloppy language, often lacks perspective on its assumptions and has developed a defensiveness that is counterproductive. There are plenty of valid critiques of psychiatry that we should consider and address.  \n\nOn the other hand, I\'ve been frustrated with rigid opinions, gross misperceptions and an echo chamber mentality in antipsychiatry. I recently found out that another psychiatrist, who engaged in entirely civil and respectful debate on r/antipsychiatry was recently banned for no good reason. I created this subreddit in the hopes of attracting antipsychiatry viewpoints to engage in civil discussion on a neutral field. I am calling this r/psychmelee in anticipation of animated discussions, but it is fundamentally an experiment which may or may not succeed. \n\n*If you have interest in helping to moderate this subreddit, please feel free to PM me. I want to ultimately have open minded moderating from all viewpoints, but at first will just try to get this operational. \n\n**Related Subreddits:**  \nr/antipsychiatry  \nr/criticalpsychiatry  \nr/psychiatry  \nr/neuroscience\n\n**Unrelated but Interesting Subreddits:**\n'),('Psychological Memes, Memes That Infiltrate The Soul','psychologicalmemes',170,'en','','Memes that will make you uncomfortable and anxious in the deepest of ways.

Wikipedia is acceptable, so long as the wiki you link to has credible sources of its own (although you are encouraged, highly, to just use those sources instead).    \n\n  2 - Titles must be as specific as possible about what you are teaching. For example, if your submission is about a broad subject like the the history of Tombstone, AZ, your title should read something like, \"Today I\'m going to teach you about the history of Tombstone, AZ\". If your submission is about something more specific, such as the Bird Cage Theater (Tombstone\'s infamous brothel), your title should read something like, \"Today I\'m going to teach you about the Bird Cage Theater of Tombstone, AZ\". In neither case should your title look like this - \"Today I\'m going to teach you about the wild west\".    \n\n  3 - This is not a \"how to\" sub. That being said, if you have a breadth of knowledge on, say, home brewing beer, feel free to share it. With such a topic, personal anecdotes and experiences are permitted (encouraged, even), as long as the technical side of what you are teaching can be sourced.    \n\n  4 - Is there something you want to learn about? Submit a request in the form of a submission and tag it appropriately, as per the example below.    \n\n  *  **[REQUEST] Joan of Arc**    \n    *Text explaining the specifics of what you want to know.*\n    \n5 - All NSFW links must be tagged (including comments).    \n\n***\n\n#COMMENT RULES    \n\n  1 - Be respectful.

It is a solution that will result in the faster, more ecient recovery \nof assets for auto lenders by bringing together a large community of people to assist in \nlocating delinquent vehicles, motivated by cryptocurrency rewards. \nWith  a  sharp  increase  in  new  auto  loans  and  delinquent  loans  over  the  last  five  years,  \nfinancing companies have become overwhelmed with the need for more ecient auto \nrepossession services. Despite this growing demand, the auto repossession industry has \nyet to see any meaningful innovation. The cost of repossession services is steep due to \nthe use of expensive License Plate Recognition (LPR) technology, and the exchange of \ninformation between repossession companies and auto lending companies is inecient, \noften resulting in the lending company having to pay extra fees to have vehicles stored \nby the repossession company before they are actually recovered.\nOur  goal  is  to  make  this  process  faster,  cheaper,  and  more  ecient  by  using  smart         \ncontracts  on  the  blockchain  and  enlisting  the  help  of  everyday  people  across  the                \ncountry. \nTo achieve this goal we are building an end-to-end technology solution that will feature a \nwebsite, mobile app and digital wallet all built upon a secure and immutable blockchain \nplatform, using the Stellar protocol for token operation and smart contracts. \nWith the Repo Coin mobile app, everyone will have the power to scan license plates and \nquickly   identify   delinquent   vehicles,   matched   against   our   real-time   database   of                \ndelinquent vehicles from lenders across the US.\nBy  enlisting  the  participation  of  lending  agencies,  auto  repossession  companies,  and  a  \ncommunity of users incentivized by cryptocurrency, we will disrupt and transform the $1 \nbillion dollar auto repossession industry in a way that has never been seen before.'),('free subreddit for adoption ','ReportAnAsshole',0,'en','','if you want this subreddit, just ask me and i will hand it over.',''),('Reposts From Us','RepostsFromUs',2,'en','','Reposts from us','RepostsFromUs'),('Reposts post','RepostsPost',6,'en','','A unique sub for Reposts of our favourite posts and reposts.

Music has become a part of human civilisation since the beginning of civilisation. Over the years, it has become institutionalized and now, music industry has become perhaps the biggest industry of them all. With the invention of internet, we have entered a new era where music tracks are being incorporated to almost everything. Nowadays, you can not even think about running a website or a blog without any embedded music. However, buying music copyright from the big names of the industry can be expensive. On the other hand, if you use copyrighted materials without the proper permission, sites like YouTube and Google will remove your content. Luckily, there is an option called [Royalty Free Music](https://www.contimusic.com) or copyright free music.\n\nThe term - royalty free music or royalty free production music can be misleading. On the surface it means, free music for which you do not need to pay additional amount of money per usage. However, the actual meaning of the term can not be far from the truth. In this case, the user purchases music for a single fee. It allows the buyer to use the music within rules and regulations set by the company that has sold them. Each company has its own set of rules that the buyer needs to follow. It does not mean that you have the right to use works of famous musicians without paying for them.\n\nThe Royalty free music libraries suffered from bad reputations in the past years. People complained that the tracks sound cheap and does not have good quality. Now the tide has changed. Almost every library has stunning scores in their collection with very high sound quality. They even allow you to listen to a part of the music before downloading. Depending on the library, you can even get the opportunity to listen to the entire track before buying. However, in those cases, there are voice recordings over the track.\n\nFinding Royalty free music is not that tough. Usually they are provided as non-profit production. There are a lot of libraries where you can download free material. The best place to look for them would be the internet. There are a lot of libraries and a huge number of tracks that you can choose from. All of them is legal to use and download. Who can say, you may even find a gem of a music among those!\n\nRoyalty free music is now playing a vital role in video product advertisement. As most of these productions are made on a tight budget, very few people can afford to buy licence from a renowned musician to use. As the buyer of royalty free music can tweak the track and needs to pay very little, their popularity is increasing. If you want, you can cut the length of the track to your necessity or play it in a loop to last through the video.'),('roy batty world','roybattyworld',2,'en','','',''),('dungeon master the rpg adventure','rpgdm',2,'en','','welcome to dungeon master an online rpg on reddit and you decide how you want your adventure go out but subcribe for more comments about dungeon master, you can also put theory\'s about dungeon masters and more but only about dungeon masters ','rose\'s are red,vilots are blues            '),('RedPill: Muslim','rpmuslim',1,'en','','Red pill approach in respect to Islam','Red pill Muslim'),('Quick text based guides for Old School Runescape','RS07Guides',5,'en','','',''),('RSVIRAL','RSVIRAL',2,'en','','',''),('River Trail Middle School','rtmswolf',2,'en','','RTMS subreddit for all you wolves.','Eat my ass.'),('Rooster Teeth Out Of Context','RToutofcontext',1,'en','','gifs or screenshots of the lovely people of Rooster Teeth but taken out of context. have fun and enjoy!',''),('rtschess','rtschess',1,'en','','rtschess','rtschess'),('Rutgers Libraries','RU_Libraries',2,'en','','A subreddit dedicated to the Rutgers Library system.

The 9 tile box is likely the most common version, but the 12 tile box offers a bigger challenge and is sweeter to win. \n\nDemo video of a few rounds of Shut the Box: https://youtu.be/iYX6-HPAmXc\n\nShut the Box on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_Box\n\nFun facts:\n\n- Rolling 12 (or any double) is a 1/36 chance of happening\n- Rolling Snakes Eyes twice in a row to start a game is to \"Shit the box\" because it is the worst round you can roll.  There is a 1/1296 chance of it happening.\n- 7 is the most common dice roll\n- Shut the Box is more luck than strategy.  One key strategy is to eliminate the highest tile (or tiles) you can per roll.\n- You can flip up 4 tiles at once if need be (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)...but the scenario will rarely happen where that\'s the best move.  A 5 tile combo is impossible since the minimum it adds up to is 15.\n'),('Shut up, Neil.','ShutUpNeil',34,'en','','This is about Neil deGrasse Tyson being annoying on Twitter.','Neil deGrasse Tyson posts annoying, \"well actually\", stuff on Twitter.\n\nThis subreddit celebrates that.\n\n\nRules:\n\n* Post stuff about Neil being annoying on Twitter, people calling out Neil, etc.\n\n* No racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and alt-rightery allowed.\n\n* I dunno, don\'t be an asshole I guess?

The idea of this subreddit is to take the slogan of a trademark/company and replace it with another one. Don\'t get what I\'m talking about? Here are some examples.\n\n\"Burger King: Eat Fresh\" (As you can see, \"Have It Your Way\", was replaced with Subway\'s slogan, \"Eat Fresh\".)\n\n\"Arby\'s: There\'s No Play Like It\" (As you can see, \"We Have the Meats\", was replaced with Nintendo\'s slogan, \"There\'s No Play Like It\".)\n\n\"Sears: Save Money, Live Better\" (As you can see, \"Life. Well Spent\", was replaced with Walmart\'s slogan, \"Save Money, Live Better\".)\n\nNow let\'s get to the rules. They should be easy to understand.\n\nRules:\n\n1) All posts must be images. If you have an idea for a Sloganswap, but don\'t have the sources to make it an image, you may submit it as text, but you must claim it as an image later on. The max amount of time your Sloganswap can stay as a text is 10 days.\n\n2) No NSFW imagery is allowed. This includes pornography, gore, or anything else that is deemed unsafe at a workplace. Yes, this includes videos and GIFs, too.\n\n3) You shouldn\'t alter the name of the brand. That\'s what r/ExpandDong and r/sbubby are for.\n\nAll types of Sloganswaps are welcome. Even if it looks chunky, or if you copy-pasted the slogan from one image to another, or if you just cut out a slogan and put it with the brand on a paper, it\'s welcome. The point is, cleanliness doesn\'t matter. What actually matters is the idea of your Sloganswap.\n\nThat\'s about all.

On top of that you can earn crypto rewards for everything you curate, and when others engage with your activity! \n\n###**How does Steepshot work?**\n\n[](/r/steepshots#censorship)\n\nSteepshot is the first photo-sharing Steem powered application. All rewards are generated by the Steem blockchain. Steem is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Every day, a fixed reward pool is distributed among all users on the Steem blockchain. By upvoting content you can control how much every post should receive. Users on Steepshot will be rewarded with STEEM and SBD (Steem dollars) which can be exchanged for fiat currencies, reinvested of held on to. \n\n###**What is the Power of Like?**\n\n[](/r/steepshots#fair)\n\nEach time you press the heart button, you spend a part of your voting power. It is constantly rebelling (recharging). The value of each of your likes depends on the Power of Like and your amount of Steem Power combined. Do not regret giving your Like Power to someone, but think who is more worthy of it! \n\n\n###**How to get more upvotes?**\n\n\n[](/r/steepshots#ads)\n\nFirst of all you need to understand, that a great amount of upvotes would not help you to earn a lot of money. It s because SP influences author payouts, not upvotes count.\nIt is better to focus on high-quality content. Try to improve constantly and you will be rewarded sooner or later.\nAnother important thing is to use correct tags. Avoid using the most popular ones (steemit, steem, etc), it only will make your post disappear very fast.\nAnd don t forget about the best time to make a post. Steepshot is being used by a great amount of people from all over the world, it means that they have different time zones.

Still, the number of transactions and interactions between distinctive entities in a typical supply-chain is almost always greater than expected.\n\nEven the most straightforward supply-chains are full of unavoidable complexities and costly inefficiencies. These logistical and communicative issues make it extremely difficult for small-to-midsize businesses to expand into global markets. Businesses using traditional supply-chain system are in dire need of more streamlined methods for participant and product interactions.\n\nSupplyBloc Technology is a blockchain integrated system that offers complete transparency, trackability, and optimization of interactions within a supply-chain network.

','Hey guys! This is our first blog post for our company, at least the first post on our website. We re very active on both our business page and my personal page. I d like to start our blog out by going into some company history a little more informally than the about section on our website. Our family has had a property management & maintenance company since I was young. My Dad eventually tapered out of the industry, but when I turned 17 I began a landscaping company. We transitioned into managing grounds of hundreds of properties within our first year.\n\nWe ended up expanding the services we provided. Now we re full on General Contractors! We have worked with hundreds of clients and have maintained literally thousands of properties all over NY state. Though in 2017 we made the decision to scale back our management portfolio and to work closer to home. Though I love our business, it was very difficult to maintain high quality standards while using sub-contractors. The only sub-contractors we use now, are ones we know personally and have known for many years. Guys that come over on Holidays and to each others birth days. As a business our gross revenue decreased but we re much happier and more passionate about the services we provide. If anyone ends up reading our blog posts, I do want to be open and let you know that I will be throwing in some key words to help our rankings on Google but the content I write is genuine.\n\nTHE BEST SYRACUSE GENERAL CONTRACTORS?\nRon, Molly, and Kathryn are the ones you ll see as the public face of the company.

Believers have been described as \"atheistic Satanists\"[4] because they believe that God is not an external entity, but rather something that each person creates as a projection of his or her own personality a benevolent and stabilizing force in his or her life.[5][6] There have been thirty printings of The Satanic Bible,[7] through which it has sold over a million copies.'),('Everything made, saved and showcased by TDarkShadow','TheDarkShadow',2,'en','','Eh.',''),('Lost photos from a time where the world was dark.','TheDarkZoneArchives',16,'en','','The Dark Zone are remains of a world where only dark existed.

I.e., [Group][Reddit][3rd].\n\n#####  Posts should be SFW. \n\nPlease refrain from anything explicit or overtly sexual in your post. You may mention that the rp is adult-themed, but we ask that you save the specifics for any inquiries made via DM. Do be sure to tag your post NSFW, however, in such cases.\n\n***\n\n* FACE CLAIMS\n\n#####  Be sure that the picture/artwork is SFW. \n\nThis means that there can be no nudity, excessive gore, or sexual content in the picture/artwork.\n\n#####  Do a quick check/search of our reddit to be certain that there\'s no duplication. \n\nWhile it\'s fine to upload several photos of the same actor/actress from one particular film, we definitely don\'t want duplicates of the same picture. Double-checking this saves the mods time and is appreciated.\n\n#####  Use a detailed title to describe your submission. \n\nFor example, \"Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell in Game of Thrones\" lets us know who the subject of the face claim is, which character they portray, and from which series it is from. If you\'re unsure of the subject of the photograph or artwork, simply describe the image/appropriate time period or genre - and do so in 300 characters or less.\n\n#####  Flair your submission with the appropriate time period or genre for ease of searching.\n\nThe flair for faceclaims is as follows: *Modern, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Medieval, Ancient History, Restoration/Regency, Civil War/Western, Victorian, and 1900s.*\n\n***\n\n* ASK A LIBRARIAN\n\n#####  Have a burning question that you\'d rather not post under your username about roleplay? \n\nAsk a Librarian by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTheRPedia) entitled \"Ask a Librarian\".

Tried and tested successfully before, diarchy increases the sense a country has of its government being shared with it and lessens the amount of chaos able to be caused by lone individuals. The idea of tyranny rests on the notion of a single, heavy handed individual using their means of controlling the state to cause it harm for their own benefit. During a diarchy, it is much more difficult for those with autocratic intentions to cause widespread destruction due to greed.\n\nThe history of the most famous coequal rulerships are somewhat mysterious but recall time long ago. If legends are to be believed, the Spartans were the first nation to have a diarchy in the western world with pure dual monarchies, and then later with the Carthaginian suffets. Later in the 509 Roman Revolution, Lucius Brutus was succeeded by Publius Valerius as both were the founding fathers of the Republic. In modern times, the current progeniture of dual executiveship, San Marino, has the oldest written constitution in the world created in 1243 yet the country was first formed around 257 AD.\n\nThe world today is entirely ruled by monarchies, chairmen, and presidents who\'ve assumed 100% of the power of their office with 45% of popular support (and sometimes less!). All nations have a dichotomous view on politics, though we make the president, who is a part of one of the \"sides\", hold supreme executive power. \n\nFinally, many despots hide behind the name president but hold such a autocratic grip over their country it dilutes and misdirects the word itself.\n\n\n\n**List of current autocrats:**\n\nGreatest power + tyranny measure\n\nXi Jiping - China\n\nEurdouan - Turkey\n\nPutin - Russia\n\nSalman - Saudi Arabia\n\nAssad - Syria\n\nDueterte - Philippines\n\nJong Un - North Korea\n\nBolsonaro - Brazil (president-elect)\n\nMaduro - Venezuela\n\nBerdimuhamedow - Turkmenistan\n\nTrump - United States\n\n**Non-malicious sole rulers or those with exceptional benevolence:**\n\nTrudeau - Canada\n\nMerkel - Germany\n\nAbe - Japan\n\nModi - India\n\n\n\n\n\n'),('Like TwoSentenceHorror But Sad','TwoSentenceSadness',6233,'en','','Posting area for two sentence sad stories.

In this way, it is a bit like Belarus or Syria, yet it does not seem this market economy has fully developed, but the country is on the road to that, without question. We can say that Eritrea is a nationalist and socially democratic state which resists the pretenses of Western imperialism, manifested mainly in the neoliberal ideology today, while not fully taking in the socialist model like Cuba or Juche Korea lets say.
